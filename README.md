This C program modifies the volume of a WAV audio file by scaling its samples. 
The user provides the input file, output file, and a scaling factor that defines how the volume should be adjusted. 
The program reads the file's header to preserve it and then manipulates the audio samples, multiplying them by the given factor to increase or decrease the volume. 
After processing, it writes the modified data to a new file. This program helps in amplifying or reducing the volume of any WAV file. 
It assumes that WAV files have 16-bit samples and ensures no memory is leaked during execution.
